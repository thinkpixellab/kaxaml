        Kaxaml is a hobby and was created to be shared, so thanks for downloading!  First of all, this
        is version 1.0 but, between you and me, it should probably still be a beta.  So far the entire
        testing team consists of me and my three year old (he's in charge of stress testing).  So 
        if you run into bugs, let me know and I'll try to fix them (there's a link in the About plugin).  On the 
        other hand, as a hobby, Kaxaml usually ends up last on my todo list so turn around might be
        slow and support pretty minimal.  Sorry.  At least it's free.

        Why Kaxaml?

        <LineBreak/>
        <LineBreak/>
        <Run>
        To be honest, I use Kaxaml less today than I did when I started this project but it's still
        an important part of my everyday workflow for WPF and Silverlight.  Here's how I use it:  
        </Run>
        <LineBreak/>
        <LineBreak/>
        <Run>
        1. There are a lot of tasks where I simply want to handcode some XAML and see the results immediately.  
        VS 2008 let's me do this, but a lot of times I want a place to brainstorm and Kaxaml is outside 
        of my project and a more comfortable environemnt for doing that.  
        </Run>
        <LineBreak/>
        <LineBreak/>
        <Run>
        2. It's good for previewing XAML.  I've got a lot of XAML files floating around on my hard drive
        and Kaxaml gives me a way to open those and see, copy or edit the XAML.
        </Run>
        <LineBreak/>
        <LineBreak/>
        <Run>
        3. Finally, Kaxaml is a handy way to learn about XAML or teach someone about XAML.  The very
        first version of Kaxaml was created for a talk I gave at MIX 06.  Now that you have a &quot;splitview&quot;
        in both VS2008 and Blend 2, there are other ways to get the immediate feedback that comes from
        typing something and seeing it update instantly. Kaxaml, though, is still a really lightweight way to
        get up and running with XAML and now that it supports intellisense, it's a good way to cut your teeth.

        <LineBreak/>
        <LineBreak/>
        <Run>
        I'm glad you asked.  This is actually the reason I put the readme together.  A lot has happened 
        since the last version.  Much of the app (most of the user interface) was rewritten and there's been 
        some serious feature creep.  More importantly, there are a couple of features that you probably 
        wouldn't discover on your own (specifically, #4, #6 and #7).  So, here are the top ten new features.

        </Run>
        <LineBreak/>
        <Run>
        This has the most requested feature by far.  I ended up writing this from scratch even though
        the text editor I've been using (see #2) already supported it because I didn't like the UI (see #3).
        The Intellisense is based on an XSD so it will be roughly equivalent to the support you get in VS2005.  
        Right
        now it only supports WPF (no Silverlight) but the plumbing is all there for a future update.

        <Run>
        I can't take most of the credit for this one because I'm hosting the editor from the SharpDevelop 
        project and I got a lot of cool stuff (syntax highlighting, line numbers, automatic indenting, 
        node collapsing, tab to space translation, etc.) for free.  A big thanks to SharpDevelop community
        for making all of this stuff easy.

        <Run>
        The New UI definitely in the spirit of original Kaxaml, but (hopefully) cleaner and nicer.  I played 
        with some other ideas (like a floating plugin bar, resizeable plugins, etc.) but I really like the 
        simplicity of the current model and didn't want to abandon it.  Visually, I purposely kept it dark and 
        flat so that whatever content you're working on is the thing that pops.  Unfortuately, I ended up 
        removing the full screen view and the ability to swap the code editor up to the top.  These are not 
        tough features to add, I just wanted to get this out the door.  Expect them in future updates.

        </Run>
        <LineBreak/>
        <Run>
        Two new things here: first, you can right click on a snippet now and edit it in a popup snippet code editor.  Second (and
        this is the hidden feature), you can assign each snippet a shortcut and then access it from a drop down in the code editor.
        The hidden part is the shortcut key.  It's Alt-Down.  Right now, there is no other way to access that.  Yeah, that's a 
        probably a design flaw but now you're part of the exclusive group who knows so let's move on. By the way, the snippets file 
        format hasn't changed so you can hang on to you original snippets.  Hopefully, you backed up your copy.  The old installer
        didn't automatically keep it around for you.  The file is in the Program Files folder and it's called KaxamlSnippets.xml.

        <Run>
        This one is pretty self explanatory.  You can open up more than one file now.  Also, if you hover over the tabs you can see
        a preview.  Ctrl+T will open a new tab.  Ctrl+W will close one.  There are some shortcomings still with tabs and hopefull I
        can fix these in a futuer version.  First, there's no tab overflow.  If you run out of room, you'll need to close some tabs 
        to see the ones at the end.  Second, I don't detect multipe instances of Kaxaml so double clicking a file will always
        create a new instance.

        </Run>
        <LineBreak/>
        <Run>
        I rewrote the color picker.  It's bigger now and you can tweak the individual RGBA or HSBA values.  Also, your pallette 
        of saved colors gets saved now.  The coolest feature, however, is the ability to synchronize the color picker with 
        your selected text in the editor.  To use this, select a color and then choose the &quot;plug&quot; button in the color picker (it's
        the top button, above copy and save).  When you do this, the color picker will update to reflect your selected color.  Then,
        as you change the color in the color picker, it updates the color in the editor.  This makes it really easy to fine tune
        or tweak colors even when you're handcoding your XAML.

        This was definitely lacking in previous versions.  Now you can zoom in our on your content.  In my prerelease use of Kaxaml, zooming
        has turned out to be most surprisingly useful feature for me.  The shortcut keys are the same as those in Blend (and most other
        design tools).  Ctrl+= will zoom in (think Ctrl++) and Ctrl+- will zoom out.  Ctrl+1 returns to 100%.  You can also

        New plugins are: XamlScrubber (it formats your XAML and removes unnecessary properties that are commonly inserted by Blend) and 
        Snapshot (it lets you save an image of your content).  The ColorPicker is also a proper plugin.  So far the actual API exposed for
        plugin authors is kind of spotty.  I've been adding stuff as I need it to build the plugins I want to build.  No one has ever
        contacted me about writing their own plugins, but if you happen to embark on this path let me know and I will happily expose
        new APIs for you.  If the plugin is cool, I'll even include in the installer or put it on Kaxaml.com if you want.  Another plugin
        which you can expect soon in a Font Chooser.  I had hoped to include it in this release, but got anxious to ship!

        Kind of anyway.  Right now it's just a big hack.  I do some preprocessing on the XAML so that I can parse Silverlight XAML as WPF
        XAML.  The hack really just involves switching out the Silverlight namespace with the WPF namespace.  That said, the plumbing to
        someday have right support for Silverlight is all there.  This will be the next thing I work on: real support for Silverlight xaml.

        There were some bugs with the file management in previous versions.  Sometimes you thought you had saved a file but hadn't.  Worse,
        sometimes you had saved a file you didn't mean to (and overwritten a previous version).  That's (hopefully) cleared up now.  Also,
        you can drag a file into app and it will open.  There's also kind of a quirky feature (but one that is super useful for me) that allows
        you to drag or paste an image and it will copy the image into a predefined directory and then generate some XAML for you.

        citizen about fixing bugs and helping you use it and I really do hope you like it.  I've used some other open source assets in building
        it.  Hopefully, I've given everyone the credit they deserve but if I somehow forgot you or used content I wasn't supposed please do let
        me know and I'll happily oblige any changes you'd like me to make.
